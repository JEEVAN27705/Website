  I'm a Computer Engineering student with a deep love for crafting software that
  actually matters. From AI-powered systems that fight online abuse, to immersive
  virtual experiences in Unity — I enjoy taking ideas across the full journey from
  concept to deployment.
</p>

<p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 mb-4">
  I am a motivated and detail-oriented developer with practical experience in both
  software development and software testing. I have a strong foundation in programming,
  web technologies, and quality assurance practices, with hands-on exposure to building
  real-world applications and testing production platforms.I am passionate about delivering 
  high-quality, reliable software solutions along with testing that create real-world impact.
</p>

<p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 mb-4">
  My experience includes manual testing, test case design, bug reporting, and regression
  testing, along with developing full-stack and machine learning–enabled applications.
  I am proficient in Python, Java, SQL, and modern web technologies, and have working
  knowledge of automation and API testing using Selenium WebDriver and Postman. I also have
  an industry expirence in manual testing.
  </p>

<p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 mb-4">

  I’m comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams using tools like Jira and Git,
  and I enjoy contributing across the software lifecycle—from development to validation—
  to deliver reliable and scalable solutions. My goal is to keep growing as a developer
  who bridges intelligent backends with beautiful interfaces and builds meaningful,
  human-centered technology.
